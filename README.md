- `Provider.of`: Understand how to access state values outside the Widgets tree.
- `ChangeNotifier`: It makes it possible to prepare a model to work as the only source of truth.
- `notifyListeners()`: Notifies the bugging of changes in the state and notifies the component of 
  the new state.
- `MultiProvider`: It is responsible for providing a means of managing multiple providers in the 
  project's Widgets tree.
